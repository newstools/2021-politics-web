MEC Debbie Schäfer on theft of National School Nutrition Programme 21 January 2021 This morning I was informed by a member of the public that canned pilchards specifically packaged for use in the National School Nutrition Programme (NSNP) were being sold in a shop in Retreat. The cans clearly state that they are packaged specifically for use in the NSNP, and are not for resale. They are exclusively for use in our schools, and can only have ended up in the shop by criminal means. We immediately reported this to SAPS. I am pleased to report that SAPS has already made an arrest, and recovered 18 cans. I commend the police for their swift action in this regard, and thank the member of the public for reporting this to us. I will follow the investigation with great interest to see how it came to be that goods destined for the NSNP ended up in private hands. I hope this serves as a warning to those who would steal from our schools. The NSNP is a vital lifeline for our most vulnerable learners. To steal NSNP food is to steal directly from the mouths of children, and it will not be tolerated. I urge all members of the public to be vigilant when purchasing goods, and to report any suspected theft of NSNP goods to SAPS.
