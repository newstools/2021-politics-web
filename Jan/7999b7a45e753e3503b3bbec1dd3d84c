Electoral Commission approaches Electoral Court for postponement of by-elections as second wave of COVID-19 sees political gatherings prohibited The Electoral Commission has once again approached the Electoral Court to postpone by-elections following the implementation of COVID-19 level 3 lockdown restrictions which have re-introduced prohibitions on political activities. The Electoral Commission is seeking the court’s approval to postpone by-elections scheduled for 20 January, 3 February and 17 February on the basis that the latest regulations curtail political activities imperiling the freeness and fairness of the elections.eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0'])); The Electoral Commission noted that even though many of the preparations for the by-elections have been concluded, and protocols are in place for the safe conducting of elections as piloted in November and December, the regulations prohibiting political activities will seriously hamper campaigning by candidates and political parties. The court application seeks to extend the 90-day period within which by-elections of councillor vacancies must take place for the following by-elections: By-election date Province Municipality Ward/s Registered voters 20 January Gauteng EKU - Ekurhuleni 43 17 886  KwaZulu-Natal KZN242 - Nqutu 11 5 742  Mpumalanga MP325 - Bushbuckridge 21 6 609 3 February Free State FS194 - Maluti a Phofung 25 4 330  Gauteng JHB - City of Johannesburg 7 & 17 37 953  Limpopo LIM344 - Makhado 38 5 681  Limpopo LIM476 - Fetakgomo Tubatse 13 6 451 17 February Eastern Cape EC441 - Matatiele 11 3 813  Gauteng TSH - Tshwane Metro 3; 58; 88; 92 55 988  KwaZulu-Natal ETH - eThekwini 110 19 291 Total: 6 provinces 10 municipalities 14 wards 163 744 The approach to the Electoral Court followed consultations with political parties via the National Party Liaison Committee during which all parties expressed support for the postponement. By-elections scheduled for 3 March by-elections currently remain on track. However, the Commission notes that voter registration is scheduled for 23 to 24 January and parties and candidates may be hindered from undertaking proper preparations for the registration weekend given the current regulations which remains in place until at least 12 January. The Electoral Commission will continue to monitor developments closely with regards to the restrictions and regulations with a view to whether to proceed or approach the court for a postponement of the 3 March by elections as well as the rescheduling any postponed by-elections as soon as possible.
