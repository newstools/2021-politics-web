The meetings formed part of the Ministers’ ongoing efforts to assist the Unions and the SABC reach an amicable end to the deadlock over retrenchments at the broadcaster. The Ministers made a number of alternative proposals to both parties to consider and explore. The SABC board has requested to be afforded time to look at the proposals in their next board meeting which will be held this coming Friday. During these meetings, the Ministers emphasised that it was in the interest of the affected employees, and the nation at large, that the parties find a win-win solution. “We were encouraged by the attitude and the spirit of the meetings with the SABC board and its executive management, and earlier with the unions. We have noted signs of progress and goodwill among the parties at the negotiating table,”   said Minister Ndabeni-Abrahams. Both Ministers maintain that all available avenues and opportunities must be explored in order to mitigate the impact on workers, particularly given the tough economic opportunities available to the public as a result of the environment following the devastating impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.
