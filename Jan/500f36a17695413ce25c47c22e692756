DA calls on Premier Makhura to take special leave pending the PPE scandal investigations 25 January 2021 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_1',112,'0','0']));The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng is calling on the Gauteng Premier, David Makhura to take urgent special leave pending the outcomes of the Special Investigative Unit (SIU) investigations into the PPE scandal. The DA is not surprised to learn that Premier Makhura has been implicated in the awarding of the multi-million personal protective equipment (PPEs) tenders by the former Gauteng Health Department chief financial officer, KabeloLehloenya. In her affidavit at the special tribunal, Lehloenya stated that Premier Makhura gave her the names of the companies to appoint to supply and deliver PPEs in the province. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));This PPE corruption scandal happened under Makhura’s watch and he didn’t do anything to prevent it. The DA calls on President Cyril Ramaphosa to ask the SIU to urgently investigate these allegations leveled against the Gauteng Premier. When this PPE scandal resurfaced, the Premier himself reported the matter to the SIU for investigation and the former Health MEC, Bandile Masuku was placed on special leave because he was implicated in the scandal. Now that the Premier has been implicated it is the time for him to take special leave pending the outcomes of the investigations. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_4',114,'0','0']));No one is above the law and due processes must be followed in all cases regardless of the position held by the person who is implicated. Should it be found that Premier Makhura is fingered he should be removed as the Premier of Gauteng as it has happened with Bandile Masuku who was removed as the Gauteng MEC for Health It is a disgrace that while the country is battling with the Covid-19, yet some leaders are using corrupt elements to enrich themselves through the Covid-19 funds. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_0',115,'0','0']));For many instances Premier Makhura has defended himself against any acts of corruption and if he is a true leader who is serious about fighting corruption in this province, he must do the right thing to take an urgent special leave pending the outcomes of the investigations. Gauteng is struggling to assist its residents who have suffered economic losses due to the Covid-19 and to procure sufficient PPEs, yet the heads of the province are looting covid-19 funds. The DA will continue to put pressure on Premier Makhura to take urgent special leave and we will closely monitor the outcomes of this investigations to ensure that those implicated face the consequences of their actions.
