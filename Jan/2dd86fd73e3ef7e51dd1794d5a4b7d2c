SANEF is disturbed by the behaviour of retired ConCourtJudget Zak Yacoob 27 January 2021 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0']));The South African National Editors’ Forum (SANEF) notes today’s developments that Cricket South Africa (CSA) interim board chair retired Constitutional Court Judge Zak Yacoob has been replaced, however we are disturbed by his behaviour and the abuse he meted towards a Sunday Times Journalist TiisetsoMalepa, who was merely doing his job. Malepa was following a story in which the suspended CSA acting CEO Kugandrie Govender alleges she was verbally harassed by justice Yacoob. Govender had written two letters of grievance on December 2 and 3 last year to the CSA members’ council, claiming she was treated unfairly by Yacoob, who is a retired judge of the Constitutional Court. Instead of answering the reporter’s questions in relation to Yacoob resorted to bullying and insults. He called the journalist “rogue and dirty” and accused him of dishonesty as well as asking questions in an “idiotic fashion”. SANEF believe that his behaviour was unacceptable and disappointing for someone of Justice Yacoob’s standing who must always act with moral authority, integrity, and propriety. SANEF therefore call on the Judge to unreservedly apologise to the journalist and the Sunday Times for his verbal attack. It is expected of all people holding senior public office to be courteous and professional.
