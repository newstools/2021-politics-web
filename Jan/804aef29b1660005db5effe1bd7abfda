National COVID-19 Antibody Survey (NCAS) not a covert vaccination attempt says Limpopo Department of Health 28 January 2021 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0']));The Limpopo Provincial Health Department and the Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC), together with research partners, Epicentre, the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD), the National Health Laboratory Service (NHLS), and the South African Medical Research Council (SAMRC), have noted some erroneous news reports and public sentiments about the COVID-19 Antibody Survey that is currently underway in various provinces, particularly Limpopo. The Provincial Health Department and the Human Sciences Research Council reiterates that this is a national survey previously announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa and the Minister of Science and Innovation, Dr Blade Nzimande. This survey aims to understand the prevalence of COVID-19 antibodies in a representative sample of people living in South African.  This will tell the research team if more people had been infected with COVID-19 than previously reported, including those who may have been infected without knowing either due to being asymptomatic, having mild symptoms, or not being able to access testing facilities. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));In this regard, the Limpopo Provincial Health Department, the HSRC and research partners unequivocally reiterate that: - This survey is only aimed at understanding the extent of COVID-19 infections in South Africa. - There is no attempt to vaccinate respondents. - Participation in the survey is also  entirely voluntary after information about the survey is presented to those who are eligible to participate. Any attempt to vaccinate those who participate in this survey, against their will and knowledge, will be unethical and in violation of their human rights.  In addition, this cannot be a covert attempt to vaccinate participants since the COVID-19 vaccine is not yet available in South Africa. When supplies of the vaccine arrive in the country, it will be rolled out according to the national vaccination strategy which will be managed by the national and provincial health departments.  Supplies will also be controlled and safeguarded in line with pre-determined protocols. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_3',115,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_4',115,'0','1']));The research team also reiterates that the interviews and blood sample collection is being administered under COVID-19 safety protocols. The processes are  safe and in no way present any danger to participants. At the same time the Provincial Health Department, HSRC and partners call on members of the community to be vigilant when approached by parties to participate in COVID-19 surveys or tests.  The team in question should provide proof of employment with the organisation they claim to represent, proof or confirmation that they are authorised to do the survey and should be appropriately branded to reflect the organisation they claim to represent. Any unscrupulous behaviour should be reported immediately. Issued by Human Sciences Research Council, 28 January 2021
