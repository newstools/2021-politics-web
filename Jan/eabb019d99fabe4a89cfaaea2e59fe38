The Information Regulator is assessing the compliance of the revised Whatsapp Privacy Policy 14 January 2021 The Information Regulator has yesterday, 13 January 2021, met to discuss the matter pertaining the revised WhatsApp Privacy Policy which has consumed many social media users of the popular chat platforms WhatsApp and subsequently Facebook. The Regulator has made contact with Facebook South Africa which has provided the Regulator with the WhatsApp privacy policy, which was revised on 04 January 2021. The engagements with Facebook South Africa are ongoing. In terms of the revised policy, it appears that there are different terms of service and privacy policies for users in the European countries and in non-European Countries. The Regulator will be analysing whether the terms of service and the privacy policies indeed differ and whether the privacy policy applicable to users outside Europe, which include the South African users are in compliance with the Protection of Personal Information Act (POPIA). The Regulator will engage with Facebook after the completion of the analysis. The Regulator remains committed to ensuring the protection of personal information of South African citizens.
