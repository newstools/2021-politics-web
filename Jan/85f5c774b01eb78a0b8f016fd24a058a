Prohibition on sales of alcohol is only going to fuel illegal sales! 12 January 2021 Why not allow online sales of alcohol? And why not allow wine farms to continue with wine tasting and wine sales? The responsible use of wine and alcohol is advocated by the liquor industry as they are required by law to do so. A total ban already has an extremely negative economic impact on the industry. Cabinet should rather work with the alcohol industry to launch a strategy to establish a culture that promotes the responsible use of alcohol. The impact of a total ban will completely destroy the economic contribution of the alcohol industry. There are strategies to keep the industry going and protect jobs. But it requires greater cooperation and exchange of ideas. Therefore, please listen to the plea of the sector! Please Mr President.
