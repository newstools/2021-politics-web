Solidarity to write to the WHO about government’s racial plans for the roll-out of vaccine  24 January 2021 This week, Solidarity will send an urgent letter to, among others, the World Health Organisation and the National Command Council about the government’s plans to promote black empowerment in the roll-out of vaccines. This comes after the Sunday newspaper, Rapport, reported that at a meeting between the ANC’s top six and the Progressive Business Forum Pres. Ramaphosa had said that the roll-out of vaccines would provide an opportunity for black empowerment. “People are dying, but the ANC’s ideology of race trumps everything. Even human lives and people’s health are made subservient to the government’s ideology of race,” Dr Dirk Hermann, Solidarity Chief Executive said. In a pandemic that is threatening people’s lives regulations must make it as easy as possible to combat the pandemic. Barriers of race dare not be part of this process. There will, no doubt, be many black businesses that will help in an efficient way. However, their involvement should be because they are going to help in an efficient way and not because they are black. The WHO’s mandate is to advise governments on how to deal with, among other things, states of disaster. The WHO will have a duty to advise the South African government on how to use the most efficient methods during a pandemic such as the one South Africa is currently facing. South Africa is in a state of disaster. All South Africans have to give up rights every day to fight the pandemic. The National Command Council must announce regulations to ensure that the procurement and roll-out of vaccines is done by the best and most efficient company. Life and health must now enjoy a higher priority than race. Issued by Dirk Hermann, Solidarity Chief Executive, 24 January 2021
