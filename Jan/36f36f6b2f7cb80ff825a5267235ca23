Minister Thoko Didiza condemns attack on farmers 29 January 2021 The Minister of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development, Ms Thoko Didiza (MP), is very concerned about the continued attack on farmers. The minister’s concern follows an attack on a farmer in Crowder near Umkhomazi, South of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN). It is alleged that the 80-year-old farmer and his wife were attacked by three (3) unknown people on their farm. “I would like to reiterate that an attack on a farmer is an attack on the country’s food security. Their role is very important in ensuring a sustainable food production for the nation and the continent at large,” said Minister Didiza. Minister Didiza calls on the law enforcement agencies to do whatever it takes to apprehend these criminals, so that law takes its cause. The minister wishes the farmer and his wife a speedy recovery.
