The Gwede Mantashe Foundation distances itself from allegations of irregular conduct 26 January 2021 In the past few days, various media houses have reported on allegations made against Mr Caswell Mokoena, a director at the Gwede Mantashe Foundation and subsequently the Gwede Mantashe Foundation. Of great concern, however, is the pattern of the news reports that have thus far sought to implicate the Patron of the Foundation, Minister Gwede Mantashe, with the actions of the director to the Foundation. We find this to be malicious and unethical. We, therefore, urge all members of the media to report accurately, factually and with objectivity on this matter. The Foundation, therefore, states as follows: The Foundation is a charitable entity that raises funds through various initiatives to support communities that are in need. For all intent and purpose, fundraising made is directed to the cause and not the foundation directly. The Foundation has not received any form of direct or indirect payments from the companies mentioned in the reports. Therefore, where allegations of irregular conduct or payments being made to an individual or entity who may happen to be associated with the Foundation, should be laid at the door of that person and/or entity. The Foundation is strongly against any individual associated with it who may abuse its official brand, any of its material, and the position they hold in it, to act in a manner that harms its image and standing and, thereby, undermine its objective. In this sense, it was erroneous of Mr Caswell Mokoena, as the COO of the Foundation, to have used the Foundation's letterhead in the manner that he did. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));The Foundation together with Mr Mokoena have concluded that Mr Mokoena be relieved of his duties, so as to allow him to deal with this matter.
