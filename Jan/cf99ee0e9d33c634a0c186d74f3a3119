SERIAL ROBBER AND MURDERER SENTENCED TO TWO LIVES AND 33 YEARS IMPRISONMENT 28 JANUARY 2021 The High Court of South Africa: Western Cape Division sentenced Blessing Bveni to two life sentences and 33 years imprisonment, following his reign of terror around the Silvermine Nature Reserve where he attacked hikers, cyclists, a woman and two children. This spate of attacks and robberies during the period of October 2017 to March 2018 resulted in the deaths of Ian McPherson and Douglas Notten, an attempted murder and robbery with aggravating circumstances of Malcolm Eesterhuizen, assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm on David Bucklow, robbery with aggravating circumstances of Megan Steel and Damian Steel and robbery with aggravating circumstances of Julia Notten. The court convicted the 33-year-old Zimbabwean national on all of the above ten counts. He was sentenced to two life terms for the two murders and a combined 33 years imprisonment for the assault and robbery of his other victims. The sentences will run concurrently. Delivering the sentence, Judge Judith Cloete remarked: "The deceased, Notten and McPherson, were subjected to brutal, frenzied attacks with the clear purpose of making sure they would not survive. Both must have died in agony. He thus appears to be a cruel and cold-hearted individual who shows no remorse." eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0']));The prosecutor, Advocate Chris Burke welcomed the sentence: "I am relieved for the family and friends of the victims who will hopefully feel some solace from the fact that justice was served. I have to commend SAPS and San Parks on the excellent investigation and quick reaction, without which this conviction and sentence of life imprisonment would have been possible. As a runner myself, I am happy to have helped to make beautiful Table Mountain a safer place to be on and enjoy." Statement issued by NPA, 28 January 2021
