Lockdown regulations discriminate against churches 28 January 2021 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0']));The current Covid-19 lockdown regulations that prohibit churches from holding services are discriminatory seeing as the required social distance can be maintained in churches just as well as anywhere else. The very same measures that apply to business enterprises and places like casinos, where certain health and safety protocols must be adhered to, should also apply to churches. In the past this is how churches operated as well and, thus, it is clear that the absolute ban on church gatherings is irrational and discriminates against churches. This unfair measure implemented by the ANC government and the relevant Minister, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma (Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs) has resulted in churches having basically no source of income under already difficult economic circumstances. This has prompted an organisation, Freedom of Religion SA, to approach the court, compelling it to incur legal costs to force the government to treat churches fairly and justly. The organisation expressed that it is unfair that places like gyms and restaurants are allowed to be open, while there is a total ban on places of worship. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_5',114,'0','0']));The FF Plus shares this sentiment and supports undertakings that aim to ensure that churches will be allowed to hold services with the necessary health and safety protocols in place. It is indeed possible. In the parliamentary Portfolio Committee, the FF Plus will put pressure on the Minister to see to it that the regulations pertaining to churches are reviewed. During these trying times when people are facings all kinds of hardship, they have a great need for spiritual support and enrichment. The unfair measures are, however, depriving them of that.
