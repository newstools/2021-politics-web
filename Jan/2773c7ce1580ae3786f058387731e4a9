EFF statement on the appointment of Minister of Small Business and Development as acting Minister in the Presidency 28 January 2021 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0']));The EFF notes the appointment of the Minister of Small Businesses, Khumbudzo Ntshavheni as the acting Minister in the Presidency. It is worthy to note that Minister Ntshavheni has achieved nothing meaningful as the Department of Small Businesses Minister. Moreover, the Department is failing to play any active and meaningful role in the development of Small businesses, with entities such as SEFA and SEDA all being in disarray. Furthermore, small businesses under her leadership, were left stranded without any government intervention when government money was given to white sunned companies. They failed to spend money and instead made unreasonable demands on small businesses which they know, cannot fulfil to access funding. The EFF reiterates its call for the Department of Small Businesses' functions to be fall back under the Department of Trade and Industry. The functions of the Department of Small Businesses ought to be linked with entities and programmes in the Development of Trade and Industry. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));The appointment of Minister Ntshavheni as acting Minister in the Presidency must be made permanent. Since some of the positions in Cabinet are created to reward cadres for their contributions toward the CR17 campaign, President Ramaphosa can reward Ntshavheni with a position in the Presidency instead of subjecting the Department of Small Businesses to an amateurish and incompetent Minister.
