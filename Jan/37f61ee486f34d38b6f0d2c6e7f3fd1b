DA investigation into ANC abuse of State Security slush fund underway 28 January 2021 The DA investigation into ANC abuse of a State Security Agency slush fund in the Western Cape, during a concerted campaign to destabilize our governance, is now underway. Following Acting Director-General Loyiso Jafta's shocking testimony at the Zondo Commission of Inquiry this week that the State Security Agency (SSA) funded ANC projects in the Western Cape, the DA will leave no stone unturned to expose this serious and outrageous abuse of public money. That the ANC could have used public money in the Western Cape, effectively stolen from the state, to undermine DA governance and destabilize the province is a matter of seditious proportions. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));At this stage we expect our investigation to include: Approaching the Independent Electoral Commission on ANC use of state funds constituting a breach of the Electoral Code of Conduct; Involving banks and financial institutions, and the financial intelligence centre, in looking into illegal transactions and transfers; eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_6',114,'0','0']));We will seek from the SSA itself further details on the ANC "projects" that were funded by them as well a breakdown of the cost of these projects; The front organizations, styled as NGOs, through which these funds may have travelled; We will seek opportunities at the Zondo commission itself to obtain further testimony; eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_4',115,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_5',115,'0','1']));We will use Parliamentary and Western Cape Legislature means to expose further facts and evidence; and Promotion of Access to Information applications will also be filed in due course. We also do not discount that a full public enquiry into this most serious matter may be needed in the Western Cape, as more evidence emerges. It is a travesty that the State, in the form of the SSA is now implicated under oath to have served as an ATM for the ANC to campaign in the Western Cape. And ANC campaigning in the Western Cape at that time was nothing short of destructive, destabilizing and violent. While political parties are constrained by the Political Party Funding Act, there are no instruments in place to prevent the ANC from using state resources for party-political purposes. The DA will fight this tooth and nail, especially in the run-up to this year's local government election, to ensure that the ANC does not use taxpayers' money for their often-dubious election campaigning.
