The project has been made possible through a partnership between the Embassy of Switzerland, the City of Cape Town, the International Public Art Festival and Cape Town based organisation Baz-Art. I am very excited that Cape Town is one of the cities chosen to be part of the Beyond Walls initiative. Cape Town is the 9th city, out of 30 to become part of this global artwork. These artworks not only connect us with the rest of the world, but placing them in Sea Point, Langa and Philippi links these spaces in our own city. As a province, we market ourselves as the Tech Capital of Africa, but we are also home to an incredibly vibrant community of creative artists. Being chosen by a world-renowned artist like Saype to host his artworks in three spaces in our city is a huge honour and further cements our reputation as a creative capital. Saype was supported in creating these artworks by over 50 local professionals and artists, further expanding the global nature of this piece. The unveiling comes just ahead of the opening of the International Public Art Festival which is being held in Cape Town next month. This open-air exhibition showcases new and existing Cape Town Street art, through guided and non-guided tours, providing a safe way for locals and visitors alike to support our local artists and the creative economy. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_1',115,'0','0']));Covid-19 and the lockdown has been a difficult time for many artists, performers galleries and cultural attractions and I urge residents to support this sector however they can. Lockdown has significant impact on tourism and hospitality sector: While I was in Sea Point, I also visited a small kayaking business to chat to them about the impact of the lockdown on their operations. Over the past year, they have been heavily impacted by the reduction in tourist numbers, especially international visitors. International tourism has in the past helped to sustain the business throughout the traditionally quieter Winter months. This is also reflected in the latest tourism data, which reflects that the sector has been hard hit by Covid-19 and the lockdown restrictions. Almost all of the province's top attractions saw a more than 60% drop in visitors over the peak festive season. eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-banner-1','ezslot_0',116,'0','0']));Tourism, hospitality and our oceans economy has been significantly impacted by the lockdown and continue to be hardest hit by the Level 3 hotspot regulations. The Western Cape has past the peak of its second wave, and we have recorded significant declines in new infections and hospitalisations. While we must and will continue to work to save lives and protect the vulnerable from Covid-19, we must also urgently focus our attention on the second pandemic of unemployment. This is why the Western Cape has written to Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize calling for the relaxation of certain restrictions in order to support jobs and start rebuilding our economy. Today, Minister of Finance and Economic Opportunities, David Maynier also wrote to Minister of Tourism Mmamoloko Kubayi-Ngubane to call for the immediate easing of restrictions which would support businesses in the tourism and hospitality sector.
