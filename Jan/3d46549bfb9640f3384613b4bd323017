The St. Gallen Symposium is a world leading initiative for intergenerational debates on economic, political and social developments. The Symposium takes place annually at the University of St. Gallen, Switzerland. During the Symposium key decision-makers from the fields of economics, politics, science, and society take part to meet and exchange with various international leaders in pursuance of the Symposium’s mission: Fostering dialogue between different generations. During the interview Mr De Klerk - Nobel Peace laureate and one of Africa’s most senior statesmen - talked about his fight to put an end to the apartheid regime in South Africa and also discussed his close relationship - personal and political - with Nelson Mandela.
