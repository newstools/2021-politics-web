Solidarity demands that Command Council abandon regulations for racial plan with vaccines 27 January 2021 Solidarity today sent a letter to the National Command Council regarding the President’s announcement that the vaccination roll-out plan will take place based on race. In the letter, Solidarity takes a strong stand against the Command Council exploiting the pandemic to promote the government’s racial ideology instead of saving lives. Previously, the President spoke out against individuals who came to the fore during the pandemic and unfairly benefited from it, especially from the provision of personal protective equipment (PPE) and scandalous food tenders. Now, with this vaccination plan, he is in fact encouraging people to benefit unfairly from it through BEE,” said Solidarity CEO Dr Dirk Hermann. The letter further highlights that plans to use BEE to implement the vaccination plan actually emphasise that the government believes that some groups in society should regard this pandemic, in which so many have lost their lives and loved ones, as a money-making opportunity. However, Solidarity believes there should be no discrimination of any kind at all, especially during the state of disaster. “The ANC puts race above all else, even at a time when people’s lives are in danger. Its actions are inexcusable. It does not focus on giving all citizens an equal opportunity and on saving lives, but instead decides to abuse the situation to enforce its racial ideology and to enable some people to enrich themselves. According to the government, almost all rights can be curtailed during a pandemic, but apparently not their obsession with race. This racial insanity must not take preference over health,” Hermann concluded. Read the letter here. Issued by Dirk Hermann, CEO: Solidarity, 27 January 2021
