The ANC NEC should disband the North West provincial administration 29 January 2021 The Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) North West calls for the disbandment of the North West legislature. The federation in the province has been disturbed by the inaction of the ANC to resolve the problems facing the provincial administration. There was a protracted battle between the ANC and its deployees on the filling of the vacancy of the MEC of COGHSTA following the death of Comrade Gordon Kegakilwe. This post was filled by the current incumbent without the blessing of the Party in the province and nationally. The alliance and the deployment committee of the ANC in the province were never consulted. We have also learned with disappointment that the members of the ANC in the legislature have voted with the members of the opposition parties in electing the chair of chairs in the legislature. This conduct is the highest form of ill-discipline and drastic steps should be taken to correct the situation. It is clear the mandate of the ANC and voters has been abandoned. The Federation is calling for a fresh elections in the province because leaders are no longer willing to represent the party, but they represent their own jackets. COSATU wants to remind all the members of the ANC in the legislature that they are all deployees of the movement. The ANC NEC needs to intervene before the situation get out of hand.
