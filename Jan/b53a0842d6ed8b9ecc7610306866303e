ActionSAwelcomes the Constitutional Court judgement forcing Zuma to testify before Zondo 28 January 2021 ActionSA welcomes today’s judgement handed down in the Constitutional Court, compelling Former President Jacob Zuma to testify before the Zondo Commission of Inquiry into State Capture. In handing down the judgement, Justice Chris Jafta emphasised that Zuma’s conduct is “in conflict with the constitutional order chosen by the Founding Fathers and Mothers of this Nation,” where the Constitution reigns supreme: “In our system, no one is above the law.” The judgement is a victory for the Rule of Law in South Africa, once again serving to highlight the independence of our judiciary. This is a central pillar of our hard-won democracy. ActionSA believes that upholding the Rule of Law is a basic requirement for us to build an inclusive and prosperous future for all South Africans. Indeed, no country can function, and no economy can grow, in a state of chaos and anarchy. Issued by Herman Mashaba, ActionSA President, 28 January 2021
