Law Society welcomes the appointment of the Legal Services Ombudsman 7 January 2021 The Law Society of South Africa (LSSA) welcomes the Legal Services Ombudsman (Ombud) appointment, retired Cape Town High Court Judge Siraj Desai. ‘This appointment is long overdue and should have coincided when the Legal Practice Council came into effect on 30 October 2018. I encourage the Department of Justice to ensure that the Ombud’s office is fully capacitated as soon as possible so that the Ombud can become fully operational. The Ombud in terms of the Legal Practice Act (LPA) is independent and only answerable to the Constitution and the law,’ says LSSA President, Mvuzo Notyesi. The LSSA commits itself to support the work of the Ombud’s office, in the broader interests of the profession and our society. The Ombud, in terms of the LPA, has the following key objectives: protect and promote the public interest in relation to the rendering of legal services as contemplated in the LPA; ensure the fair, efficient and effective investigation of complaints of alleged misconduct against legal practitioners; promote high standards of integrity in the legal profession; and promote the independence of the legal profession. Besides, other powers, the Ombud is competent to investigate any alleged act or omission that may affect the integrity and the independence of the legal profession and public perceptions in respect thereof.
