These appointments are made by Minister Lindiwe Zulu, Minister of Social Development. The appointment will be effective from 1 February 2021 for a period of 2 years or until the Fund Raising Act 107 of 1978 is repealed, whichever occurs first. The objective of the fund is to render humanitarian relief to persons, organizations and bodies who or which suffer damages or loss caused by a disaster. Campher will have a fiduciary responsibility to ensure that relief is administered as stipulated in the Fund Raising Act 107 of 1978. Campher is currently managing Agri SA’s Risk and Disaster Unit which includes the imminent establishment of the Agri SA Disaster Relief Foundation. She has been actively involved in the administration of drought aid to the value of approximately R27 million to provincial affiliations as well as Agri SA’s Surplus Food Aid Campaign. Through this campaign, more than 400 tons of food parcels were distributed to hunger-stricken communities throughout South Africa during the last year. Agri SA looks forward to Campher’s contribution as member of the Disaster Relief Fund Board. Issued by Christo van der Rheede, Executive Director, Agri SA, 28 January 2021
