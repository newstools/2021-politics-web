Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi alive and well 18 January 2021 Due to an unfortunate error on a call-in radio show this past weekend, a rumour has emerged that IFP Founder and President Emeritus, Prince Mangosuthu Buthelezi MP, has passed away. This is absolutely untrue and unfounded. We wish to reassure the many friends, supporters and colleagues of Prince Buthelezi that he is alive and well. While he is grieving the loss of so many due to the Covid-19 pandemic, he himself is in good health and continuing with his responsibilities as a Member of Parliament. To fully correct the error, we must note that it was Prince Butheleziâ€™s cousin and praise-singer who tragically passed away. One caller on a radio show badly misspoke, without being corrected by the host, and the family is now being inundated with frantic calls and deep concern. We reiterate that there is no cause for alarm. Thankfully, we are still blessed with the presence of our Founder and President Emeritus.
