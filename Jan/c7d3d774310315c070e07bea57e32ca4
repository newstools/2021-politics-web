Third Quarter production and employment statistics – Some puzzles  15 January 2021eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0'])); INTRODUCTION This is the sixteenth and final brief in a series on the economy, published over a period of six months[1]. All the statistical information about production and employment in the third quarter has now been published: monthly production statistics, third quarter GDP, and third quarter employment and earnings from the Quarterly Labour Force Survey and the Quarterly Employment Survey[2]. This brief focuses on puzzles which arise when all the sources are considered together. THE EVOLUTION OF GDP IN 2020 Table 1 presents key magnitudes from GDP statistics in the first three quarters of 2020. Table 1eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_4',114,'0','0']));  Q1 Q2 Q3 GDP estimated from production    Compensation of employees 593,326 555,758 597,639 Gross operating surplus 522,389 431,389 543,203 Value added at basic prices 1,115,715 987,146 1,140,842 Taxes less subsidies on products 162,153 88,495 131,158 GDP at market prices 1,277,868 1,075,641 1,272,000 GDP estimated from expenditure    Final consumption expenditure by households 756,238 640,875 749,300 Final consumption expenditure by general government 275,338 272,110 281,844 Gross fixed capital formation 211,793 173,281 193,073 Change in inventories -35,592 -19,704 -55,092 Exports of goods and services 378,843 290,512 408,548 Less: Imports of goods and services 340,293 276,973 310,245 Residual[3] 31,541 -4,460 4,571 Expenditure on gross domestic product 1,277,868 1,075,641 1,272,000 Table 1 indicates that: Both compensation of employees and gross operating surplus more than fully recovered to their Q1 levels in Q3, meaning that value added at basic prices did too. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_2',115,'0','0']));Taxes (VAT and excise taxes) less subsidies on products in Q3 did not fully recover to their Q1 level, dropping by 19.1%[4]. This meant that GDP at market prices dropped slightly between Q1 and Q3. Final consumption expenditure by households, after a sharp drop in Q2, very nearly recovered to the Q1 level in Q3. Government expenditure, which dipped very little in Q2, more than recovered to the Q1 level in Q3. On the other hand, investment did not recover to Q1 levels in Q3. Gross fixed capital formation was 8.8% lower in Q3, and there was disinvestment in inventories in each of the three quarters, with the sharpest drop in Q3[5]. There was a positive balance of trade in each of the quarters, with the greatest surplus in Q3. The value of exports in Q3 was 7.8% higher in Q3 than in Q1, while the value of imports was 8.8% lower. On the whole, Table 1 presents a picture of near complete economic rebound in Q3 after the sharp drop in Q2. Consumption in Q3 is very nearly back to the Q1 level. Collection of taxes on production can be expected to improve after COVID tax deferral ends and enterprise cash flow improves. eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-banner-1','ezslot_1',116,'0','0']));What happens next on the investment front will depend on business confidence. The Bureau of Market Research’s business confidence index was 18 in Q1, 5 in Q2, and has rebounded to 40 in Q3, its highest level since Q3 of 2018[6]. The upside risk is improving global confidence, especially if the roll out of COVID 19 vaccines proceeds rapidly. The downside risks are the second wave of the South African epidemic and further deterioration in the fiscal position. EMPLOYMENT The employment data from the QLFS and QES are less encouraging. Table 3 sets out employment indices. Table 3 Employment indices (Q1=100)     Q1 Q2 Q3 GDP    Value added 100.0 88.5 102.3 QLFS    All employed 100.0 86.4 89.7 Formal employment outside agriculture, households 100.0 89.2 91.4 Agriculture and private households 100.0 82.7 88.4 Informal employment outside agriculture, households 100.0 78.1 84.1 All working 100.0 73.6 86.6 QES    Formal employment outside agriculture, households 100.0 93.2 94.0 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-large-leaderboard-2','ezslot_5',117,'0','0']));When interpreting Table 3, bear in mind that the QLFS and the QES employment data include furloughed employees. It is possible to calculate an index of those who did any work in the reference week from QLFS data, and it is shown in Table 3, but no corresponding measure is contained in the QES data. The QLFS indicates that retention of employees was greatest in the formal sector outside agriculture and households. The QES indicates greater retention in this sector in the QLFS. Even so, employment has not bounced back to the extent of value added. The QLFS indicates that 17% of employees in agriculture and 22% of employees in the informal sector lost their jobs or closed their businesses in Q2 and that the bounce back has not been great. For some, in these two sectors, COVID regulations may have inhibited reabsorption in Q3. If so, further bounce back can be expected in Q4. COMPENSATION OF EMPLOYEES Data on the compensation of employees are more incoherent than data on employment. Table 4 sets out the available information: Table 4 Variable Q1 Q2 Q3 GDP (R billion) 593.3 555.8 597.6 Index 100.0 93.7 100.7 QES (R billion) Formal sector outside agriculture, households 724.1 644.7 680.2 Index 100.0 89.0 93.9 QES Average monthly wage (R) Formal sector outside agriculture, households 22,395 21,448 22,579 Index 100.0 95.8 100.8 The only earnings data we have indicate that average wages in the formal sector outside agriculture and households did not fall far in Q2 and have completely recovered in Q3. The main movement in aggregate earnings in the QES was caused by changes in employment. The QES indicates that earnings were consistently higher than compensation of employees recorded in the GDP and the movement in them has been different. CONCLUSION If and when COVID 19 is wholly or nearly completely eliminated from human populations, econometricians may try to estimate the impact of the epidemic on the South African economy. They will not have an easy task. A full analysis would consider the global as well as the local course of the epidemic. And it would have to cope with the fact that different sources of data on the South African economy say different things. For now, we can only wait to see what happens next.

[2]Bear in mind that revisions have been made to some of the Q1 and Q2 magnitudes reported in earlier briefs. These revisions are standard practice in the light of new information. [3]The residual is a balancing item, reflecting the fact that magnitudes on both the production and expenditure sides are estimates and that their totals do not reconcile exactly. [4]The VAT rate did not drop over the period and some excise taxes rose. The drop in collections may be partly as a result of the COVID tax deferral programme, and cash strapped businesses may have fallen behind in payments. [5]However, the Quarterly Financial Statistics for the second quarter recorded an increase in inventories for all the sectors it covers in both the second and third quarters. [6]It has been above 50 only in two quarters in the last ten years.
