The FF Plus also wants to sympathise with the ANC where Mr Mthembu was a hard worker and true stalwart. He served as Chief Whip of the ANC and in Parliament for many years and he acquitted himself very well of his task. On a personal level, he was always friendly and treated others with respect. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));During his life, Mr Mthembu had experienced various traumatic incidents due to crime. Among other things, he was the victim of an armed robbery during which he was shot numerous times. He survived and continued to perform his duty. Mr Mthembu was known as someone with a pleasant disposition, he was a pillar of the ANC and he will be sorely missed.
