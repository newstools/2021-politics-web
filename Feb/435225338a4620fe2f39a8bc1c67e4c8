Committee on Transport welcomes new PRASA CEO and calls for all hands on deck 27 February 2021 The Portfolio Committee on Transport notes with appreciation the appointment of a permanent Chief Executive Officer (CEO) for the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa). The Chairperson of the committee, Mr Mosebenzi Zwane, said the appointment will bring stability to the entity which, since 2015 has been without a CEO. He said: “Prasa is a crucial entity not only for job creation, but also for providing a service that enables many poor South Africans to access job opportunities. We welcome this positive initiative which, in no smaller measure, strengthens the board of directors and what they want to achieve.” Mr Zwane added: “Much vandalism has occurred on our rail infrastructure rendering the entity mostly dysfunctional. This appointment must help assist Prasa to get back trains on the rails. Furthermore, the appointment of the CEO must help Prasa realise its mandate to transport poor South Africans.” The Minister of Transport, Mr Fikile Mbalula, announced today Mr Zolani Kgosie Matthews as the new Prasa CEO. The announcement follows an announcement of a new board which was made recently. Mr Zwane said Prasa’s important task is to revive rail infrastructure and such a task requires all to work together for better Prasa. He said a special focus should be on the productive lines for the entity like the central line in Cape Town and Mabopane in Johannesburg. The committee wished Mr Matthews well in this massive undertaking and said the real work starts now. Issued by Sibongile Maputi, Media Officer, Parliamentary Communication Services, 27 February 2021
