EFF calls for withdrawal of SAPS from SONA 11 February 2021 The Economic Freedom Fighters calls for the immediate withdrawal of the mass deployment of police in an empty parliament that will only be attended by a total of fifty people. The ruling party, in a shallow obsession with colonial ceremony has deployed South African Police Services to parliament to rubber stamp their wasteful expenditure on the State of the Nation Address. This deployment of police in their numbers to SONA is nothing but an abuse of power and represents the highest level of arrogance, as it only serves to distract police resources from combatting violent crime in the service of the small egos of Cyril Ramaphosa and his cronies. There is no logic to the deployment of SAPS in a Parliament that is largely set to be attended virtually, where there are no guests and as a result no threats to be combated. Why should taxpayers money be unnecessarily wasted for an individual like Ramaphosaâ€ž who can't even guarantee simple life-saving resources such as vaccines which are desperately needed by South African. It is nothing but a show to legitimize corruption, because a State of the Nation Address that will have little to no attendance should not require any expenditure of tax payers money. Ramaphosa is abusing and wasting state resources, in collaboration with Bheki Cele who has a history of corruption and wants to use the Sona to loot during a pandemic. The ANC government is missing out on an opportunity to save South Africans money and abandon the ridiculous and wasteful colonial ceremony that surrounds occasions such as SONA, which are meant to give guidance on the plan to revive our economy and better the lives of our people. The EFF demands the immediate withdrawal of all members of SAPS and for them to be redirected to fight real crime, not legitimize a ceremony of looters.
