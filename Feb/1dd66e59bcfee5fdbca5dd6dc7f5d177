Only greater public engagement can #KillTheBill and protect property rights for all - IRR 4 February 2021 The extension of the deadline for public comment on the Expropriation Bill is a victory for all South Africans who have joined the IRR’s campaign to protect property rights. The Expropriation Bill is a draconian assault by the state on the rights, aspirations, and freedom of citizens and a threat to the ability of all South Africans to securely own what they have worked hard to earn. This extension of the period for public comment to the end of February is an important if small victory for all those who want South Africa to be free and prosperous. It shows how public pressure and participation can achieve results, even against ANC lackeys and government ideologues intent on expanding the power of the government at the expense of the freedom and aspirations of people. This fight against Patricia De Lille’s slippery and dishonest propaganda on behalf of the ANC and this Bill is a crucial battle in the broader defence of property rights for all South Africans. Said Hermann Pretorius, IRR Head of Strategic Initiatives: “While we cannot be certain of victory if South Africans stand with us in this fight to #KillTheBill, we can be certain of defeat if South Africans don’t. “Too much is at stake, and too much has been lost and damaged in recent years as a consequence of people opting to remain on the sidelines. As long as that holds true, the fight for a free South Africa for all its people will end in defeat.” Issued by Hermann Pretorius, IRR Head of Strategic Initiatives, 4 February 2021
