EFF statement on United Nationsâ€™ condemnation of white supremacy 23 February 2021 eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0']));The EFF has today been vindicated by the United Nations Secretary General who called out loudly on the reality of existence of white supremacy and labelling it a transnational crime. In his opening remarks to the United Nations Human Rights Council yesterday, His Excellency, Antonio Guterres correctly characterised these phenomena as representing the number one internal security threat in several countries and that they travel internationally to network their hateful ideologies with their counterparts found in the KuKluxKlan cults, the Zionist and Nazist. Here at home, these fascist racist white minority groups traverse the world, seeking sympathy from disgraced leaders like Trump in USA with no consequences from an African government. The ruling party leaders wine, dine and kiss them in every public platform seeking validation from the most cruel system of exploitation that continues to kill and abuse farm workers, domestic and retail shop workers. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_2',113,'0','0']));These groups had the audacity to invade beaches in the midst of Covid19 pandemic, block roads and burn police vehicles, conducts that would invite a repeat of Marikana Massacre if it were Africans. These racist groups roam freely, feel entitled as our own police service act with partiality and imbalanced, ravaging any African protest with rubber bullets, water cannons and jail time whilst white protestors take photo pictures with the same public order policing unit. We have repeatedly said that white supremacy exists, particularly in South Africa and we earned a vicious backlash from apartheid apologists condemning us as enemies of social cohesion and unity, coercing us to accept the utopian doctrine of Rainbow Nation. White leaders in South Africa have denied that apartheid is crime against humanity with shear impunity. We have been castigated and condemned for calling out white supremacy for what it is in Brackenfell, Senekal, Clicks and in many other instances. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_4',114,'0','0']));This should stop.
