DA welcomes the dismissal of Health MEC 18 February 2021 Note to Editors: You can download a sound clip in English by Bobby Stevenson, MPL The Democratic Alliance welcomes the news that Premier Oscar Mabuyane has fired Health MEC SindiswaGomba. The dismissal of MEC Gomba is long overdue, as the DA has been calling for Mabuyane to fire her since May last year. Gomba’s performance as the MEC for Health since her appointment has been plagued with failures, weak leadership and serious allegations of corruption. Given the cloud that has been hanging over her, it is unbelievable that it has taken so long for Premier Mabuyane to act. This shows the extent to which the ANC puts the party ahead of the people. In a capable state, leaders should be appointed on merit and not through cadre deployment. Issued by Bobby Stevenson,DA Leader in the Eastern Cape Provincial Legislature, 18 February 2021
