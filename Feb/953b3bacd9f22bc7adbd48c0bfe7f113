Western Cape Health Department refuses ivermectin; disregards court order 10 February 2021 AfriForum today sent an urgent letter to the Western Cape Department of Health after it came to light that the department refuses the use of ivermectin for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19. The organisation informed the department that it was disregarding a court order and also asked the department to reverse its decision. AfriForum acquired a court order on 2 February which stipulates that anyone is allowed to use ivermectin. The court order further declares that doctors are allowed to apply to the South African Health Products Regulating Authority (SAHPRA) to prescribe ivermectin to patients and that, when deemed an emergency, doctors can treat a patient with ivermectin concurrently with the submission of an article 21 application to SAHPRA. AfriForum has given the Western Cape Department of Health until Thursday 11 February at 08:00 to reverse this decision. “The Western Cape Department of Health is blatantly ignoring a court order and not acting in the interest of patients by making this decision. They are also discriminating against those who don’t have access to private medical care. Ivermectin has been used for decades and could possibly alleviate the burden health workers are currently carrying. We therefore urgently appeal to the Western Cape Department of Health to reverse their decision,” says Barend Uys, Head of Research at AfriForum.
