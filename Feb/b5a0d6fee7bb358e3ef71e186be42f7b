A total of 2756 vaccines had been administered to healthcare workers in the province by 5pm yesterday. This is the biggest vaccination drive in the province and the country, with a number of technical and logistical moving parts. We have been working hard to ensure that the rollout has been smooth and to make adjustments as required. I am heartened by the growing number of vaccinations being administered daily. Healthcare workers who are interested in receiving the vaccine, and who have not yet done so, must register on the electronic system. Once registered, you will be allocated a vaccination and site to go for the vaccination. I am regularly asked by members of the media and members of the public whether I will be getting vaccinated. I fully intend to get vaccinated, but I will not be doing so at the expense of our healthcare workers who have been on the frontline fighting Covid-19 for nearly a year now. They must be our priority. The entire Western Cape cabinet has made the same commitment to wait until it is our turn, in phases two and three of the vaccination rollout. The rollout of this J&J vaccine implementation study is very exciting news but it does not mean we can let our guards down. We must continue to be vigilant and ensure that we are still wearing our masks correctly, washing our hands regularly and practicing social distancing. Avoiding crowds, close contact and confined spaces can help to prevent infection and protect you and your loved ones.
