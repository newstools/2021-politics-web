IFP Welcomes NSC Results of 76.2% Despite Drop in Pass Rate 23 February 2021 Today we celebrate together with all the learners and teachers on the release of the National Senior Certificate (NSC) results by Basic Education Minister, Angie Motshekga. The overall pass rate of 76.2% is welcomed, amidst the numerous challenges faced by schools, teachers and the Department of Basic Education (DBE) in ensuring that all learners who qualified for the 2020 NSC examination were able to write their matriculation exams. We congratulate all learners on a job well done in obtaining this pass rate. The learners and staff of 2020 must be commended for soldiering on through the tough conditions created due to the Covid-19 pandemic. We further note the acceptance, approval and quality of the NSC results by Umalusi - despite the challenges of the Maths and Science Paper leaks. To the learners who did not achieve the results they desired, we encourage you to re-write your matric exams again this year, as you can still create your better future. A job well done to all!
