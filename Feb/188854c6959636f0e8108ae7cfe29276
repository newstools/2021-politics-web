DA welcomes Mbalula’s announcement that decision on e-Tolls will be made by end of March 18 February 2021 Note to editors: Please find a soundclip from DA Gauteng Shadow MEC for Roads and Transport in Afrikaans  here and English here The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Gauteng welcome’s Transport Minister, Fikile Mbalula’s indication that national government will provide certainty about the future of e-Tolls by the end of March. However, the DA calls on him to stick to his promise this time. For the past 18 months, Mbalula has been continuously kicking this can down the road. The DA hopes that he has finally reached the end of that road and that it will not be another false start. In light of recent announcements that all toll fees will soon increase, despite the desperate state of our economy and subsequent damage to many livelihoods during the lockdown, it is even more important to get rid of e-Tolls as soon as possible. e-Tolls must go and any other announcement by the Minister cannot be acceptable. The people of Gauteng must no longer be burdened by this nonsensical system. Issued by Fred Nel,DA Gauteng Shadow MEC for Roads and Transport, 18 February 2021
