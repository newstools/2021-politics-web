Solidarity honours present-day heroes in healthcare sector 1 February 2021 Solidarity and Solidarity Helping Hand today paid homage to healthcare workers by putting up a white ribbon around Unitas Hospital in Centurion as a symbol of gratitude for the country’s healthcare workers. “Words cannot express our gratitude for healthcare workers’ hard work. We admire their strength, courage and sacrifice. Healthcare workers are the present-day heroes of South Africa. They work incredibly long hours under difficult circumstances, and they are disproportionately exposed to the virus. Therefore, they deserve our extraordinary support,” said Solidarity CEO Dr Dirk Hermann. Furthermore, Solidarity encourages everyone to take part in this action by writing a message of appreciation to all doctors, nurses and support staff. “It is an incredible honour to be able to stand outside a hospital and pay homage to our healthcare workers with the knowledge that heroic deeds to save people’s lives are currently taking place inside this building. Everyone who is able to do so, please make an effort to come in person and write a message for our healthcare workers on the white ribbon. Those who cannot, we encourage you to write such a message on our website, and then we will put it on the ribbon ourselves,” Hermann added.
