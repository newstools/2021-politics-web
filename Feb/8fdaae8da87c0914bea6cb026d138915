EFF condemns schools prohibiting learners from registering due to outstanding school fees 11 February 2021 The EFF condemns in the strongest terms schools that are barring learners and pupils from registering in primary and high schools, due to outstanding fees. We have received reports that there are schools that are restricting students from registering, withholding report cards and textbooks from learners due to outstanding school fees. These actions are not only pathetic and inhumane, but are illegal and represent the highest form of disdain for children and the youth of this country. To stop innocent children from accessing education because of their financial background is the highest form of cruelty and inhumanity. Any form of exclusion of children, be it withholding textbooks, or demanding parents to buy children their own toilet paper or pay money towards toiletries and related amenities is a direct sabotage of this country's future. These actions are contributing factors to primary and high school dropouts, as children are reluctant to return to school due to humiliation of not having their results and fear of being chased away from school by teachers and Principals who have no grasp of the law or the value of education. The EFF calls on all parents who are unable to register their children at school, have not received their children's results or have received ridiculous demands to purchase personal toiletries for their children to report this to the EFF on its various social media platforms. Such cases will be attended to swiftly and the registration of children will be secured regardless of whether they have money or not. We must boldly oppose any attempt to make education a privilege of those who have money, and must ensure the arrest of any teacher or principal who seeks to condemn the youth of this country to drugs an unemployment by standing in their way of getting education.
