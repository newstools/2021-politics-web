Why have new doctors still not been paid in Gauteng? 11 February 2021 I am astonished and disheartened that the Gauteng Health Department has still not paid more than 60 young doctors since the beginning of this year despite appeals to officials and to Gauteng Premier David Makhura. According to the SA Medical Association Trade Union (Samatu) at least 48 medical interns, 14 community service doctors and several doctors under Covid-19 contracts have not been paid in Gauteng. These doctors have worked for 40 hours a week and more than 80 hours of overtime a month. This non-payment is utterly inexcusable and highlights the continuing mismanagement in the Gauteng Health Department. Late payment of new doctors happened last year as well. Procedures should surely have been put in place to ensure that it not happen again. Premier David Makhura has also been unresponsive in this matter, which is another instance of his unfitness to govern. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));It is high time that poor leaders are booted out and frontline workers are given the priority they deserve. The doctors should be paid forthwith. Issued by Jack Bloom,DA Gauteng Shadow Health MEC, 11 February 2021
