DG’s suspension merely a smokescreen to protect other high-ranking officials at DIRCO 15 February 2021 While the Democratic Alliance (DA) welcomes the suspension of the Department of International Relations and Cooperation’s (DIRCO) Director-General (DG), Kgabo Mahoai, by Minister Naledi Pandor, we are of the belief that this suspension is merely a smokescreen to protect other high ranking officials within the Department who have been closely associated with the highly controversial R118 million New York Pilot Project. The Auditor-General in its 2017/2018 Financial Year Report, identified DIRCO’s procurement process of property in New York as being in contravention of Treasury Regulations when it was revealed that the South African Diplomatic Mission in Manhattan had bought a rundown, dilapidated building and not vacant land as originally stipulated. A report by Parliament’s Portfolio Committee on International Relations and Cooperation, found that Ambassador Jerry Matjila, who was the accounting officer when the procurement for the New York Pilot Project was approved in 2016/2017, and the DIRCO Chief Financial Officer, CaiphusRamashau, who would jet into New York to engage in private discussions with real estate agents, should be amongst those placed under suspension immediately. The DA therefore calls for the immediate suspension of Matjila and Ramashau as they clearly have a case to answer for. We will also be writing to Minister Pandor demanding an explanation as to why Matjila and Ramashau have not been placed on suspension together with the DG. Mohoai’s suspension only scratches the surface and reinforces the belief that there are officials within the Department, who seem to have the protection of their senior leaders/ handlers and therefore believe they are untouchable. It is of serious concern that Minister Pandor, who has been informed by the Portfolio Committee since its first sitting with her about the shenanigans that had surrounded the New York Pilot Project, has only now decided to take action. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_2',114,'0','0']));It is clear that this is yet another example of the ANC government’s cadre deployment and one would not be surprised that the protection that these officials seem to be enjoying, emanates from President Ramaphosa’s cadre deployment committee.
