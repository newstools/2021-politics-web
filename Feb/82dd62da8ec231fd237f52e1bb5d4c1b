Deputy Secretary General Comrade Jessie Duarte letter to the Honourable Chief Justice Zondo on an Op-ed published in the Daily Maverick and expressing continued support to the work of #statecapturecommissionofenquiry. 14 February 2021 THE HONOURABLE DEPUTY CHIEF JUSTICE ZONDO STATE CAPTURE COMMISSION OF ENQUIRY 12 FEBRUARY 2021 CC: PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC OF SOUTH AFRICA HIS EXCELLENCY CYRIL RAMAPHOSA HONOURABLE DEPUTY CHIEF JUSTICE On 10 February an article was published in my name which, upon reflection, I believe I owe you an apology. The article appears to speak to your person directly and for this I humbly apologize to you. It was not my intention to show any disrespect towards you personally. The article which was published in the Daily Maverick was a reflection of several witnesses who appeared not to know that the current system of our National Assembly is premised on a proportional representation system, largely in line with the Westminister model which provides for a whippery system. I wish to assure the Honorable Deputy Chief Justice of my deep respect for you and the work you are doing to bring to the fore the depth of malfeasance in the state and in the private sector. Yours sincerely Jessie Duarte, Deputy Secretary General African National Congress
