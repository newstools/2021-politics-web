MKMVA NEC to visit president Zuma at Nkandla 8 February 2021 The Umkhonto we Sizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMVA) National Executive Committee (NEC) will pay a visit to President Jacob Zuma on Thursday the 11th of February 2021. The visit will take place at 13:00. This year is the 60th Anniversary of the formation of Umkhonto we Sizwe (MK) on the 16th of December 1961. As part of our celebrations the MKMVA NEC will be visiting the older generation of comrades of MK, whom we are blessed to still have among us, including - among others - the remaining comrades of the Luthuli Detachment. It is in this context that MKMVA will pay the first of these planned visits to President Zuma, in order tohonor him as our Patron in Chief. Furthermore, this visit is also the execution of a decision of the last NEC meeting of MKMVA, which resolved that the MKMVA NEC must visit President Zuma and pledge our support to him in the face of the constant attacks that he is being subjected to. There is no doubt in our minds that President Zuma is being deliberately targeted, and treated extremely badly. MKMVA is deeply disturbed by the recent ruling by the Constitutional Court, which endeavors to force President Zuma to present himself before Mr. Justice Zondo, who is evidently prejudiced against him. We are furthermore perturbed that a most basic and fundamental constitutional right was taken away from President Zuma by the ruling of the Constitutional Court, namely his right to remain silent and not to incriminate himself. MKMVA will show our support for President Zuma not only through this planned visit of our NEC, but also through a programme of action in support for President Zuma, that we endeavor to undertake. This programme of action we will discuss with President Zuma during our visit. The NEC of MKMVA led by the President of MKMVA, comrade KebbyMaphatsoe, will after the visit address the media.
