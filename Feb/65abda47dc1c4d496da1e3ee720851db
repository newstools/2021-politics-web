ANC CAUCUS WELCOMES JUDGEMENT ON ANC MP ADV BONGANI BONGO'S BRIBERY CASE The ANC Parliamentary Caucus welcomes the judgement by the Western Cape High Court that has found ANC MP Adv Bongani Bongo not guilty of bribery accusations levelled against him. eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0']));As the ANC in Parliament, we have stood firm that the law must take its course, therefore, we appreciate and commend the work of the judiciary in ensuring that justice prevails. We also commend Comrade Bongo for adhering to the prescripts of the South African laws until his name was cleared by the courts. Following today's judgement, the ANC Caucus will lay a complaint with the Ethics Committee of Parliament against the Leader of the Democratic Alliance, Mr John Steenhuisen, who opened charges against Cde Bongo based on lies. These allegations, which have been proven to be untrue and subsequently dismissed by the court, caused damage to the reputation of Cde Bongo and the ANC in Parliament and we will urgently request that Parliament takes the necessary measures to deal with the DA leader. As the Majority Party in Parliament, we reaffirm that we respect and abide by the Constitution and the laws of our country. Issued by the Office of the Chief Whip: Hon.
