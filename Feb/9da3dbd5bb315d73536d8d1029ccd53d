Citizenry must maintain pressure to end unfair lockdown regulations 1 February 2021 The civil rights organisation AfriForum encourages civil institutions to maintain pressure on the government to ensure that irrational regulations that are economically and socially devastating, come to an end. The increased pressure that was exercised by citizenry over the past days contributed to the relaxation of the lockdown regulations that pres. Cyril Ramaphosa announced tonight. This announcement confirms once again the importance of organised communities to balance state power. “The confirmation that no one will be forced to use the vaccine, is positive. However, the fact that it was even necessary for the president to mention this, indicates that the confidence in the government is currently at a low point. The total lack of any announcement regarding the prosecution of people that misused the pandemic to commit corruption, will only deepen this mistrust,” says Barend Uys, Head of Research at AfriForum. AfriForum welcomes the adjustment of the curfew that will make it more viable for restaurants to conduct business. The announcement that restaurants, wine farms and micro-breweries are allowed to sell alcohol again, will also contribute to the prevention of more job losses in these industries. “A more rational policy, that ensures that more jobs in the private sector are not being lost, must be a priority now,” Uys concludes.
