NLC tries to block answers on R7 million Carol Bouwer grant 6 February 2021  The Democratic Alliance can reveal through answers to a Parliamentary question, that the National Lotteries Commission (NLC) tried hide answers to the now infamous R7 million grant to well-known media personality, Carol Bouwer. The grant was made to her NPO “Venalor”, however it is still not known what the grant was for or how it was used. In an answer to my question, the NLC attempted to hide behind the SIU investigation into the scandal-ridden organisation and stated that only the SIU could determine if the NLC could answer the question and be accountable to Parliament. Of course the logic of this is laughable at best and sinister at worst. We are still non the wiser as to why Ms Bouwer's organisation received this money and I will eagerly await the intervention of Minister Patel who has now assured me he will get the answers from the commission. For far too long, the NLC has protected and defend corruption and maladministration with impunity, despite our repeated requests for over a year for the board to be dissolved. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));That is why the DA has called for a debate of National Importance so Parliament can take charge of this crisis that the Executive refuse to act on. The DA will not rest until money distributed to individuals like Carol Bouwer are accounted for and their projects properly assessed, as well as ensuring that the charitable caucuses they represent are uplifting those they claim are beneficiaries.
