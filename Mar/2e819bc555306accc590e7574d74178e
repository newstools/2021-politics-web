DA calls on Tourism MEC to release feasibility study and open Modimong Nature Reserve to boost the local economy 2 March 2021 Note to Editors: Please find the attached soundbite in English and Setswana by SelloSeitlholo, MP, the DA Constituency Head in the Greater Taung Local Municipality. The Democratic Alliance (DA) in Taung will request our Member in the Provincial Legislature, Jacqueline Theologo, to write to the MEC for Economic Development, Environmental Conservation and Tourism (DEDECT), KenetsweMosenogi, to get clarity as to why, after two years and spending nearly R1 million on a feasibility study on Modimong Nature Reserve the report has not been tabled in her department. The Modimong Nature Reserve study was conducted in 2018 and to date, the report is still gathering dust. In August 2020, the DA wrote to the Chief Director of the Tourism Department, Lebo Diale, requesting clarity on the study and progress within the department, but to date, there is still no feedback. The study was conducted to determine the feasibility of establishing a nature reserve in the village of Modimong in Greater Taung. The establishment of a nature reserve will be of economic significance, not only for Taung but the North West province’s tourism sector. Tabling the report at the North West Department of Economic Development, Environmental Conservation and Tourism will head start the opening of the nature reserve and ensure transparency throughout the process. Opening the nature reserve will benefit the surrounding communities by boosting the local economy and subsequently create job opportunities, especially for the youth in Greater Taung.
