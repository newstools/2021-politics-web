DA reiterates call for transparency on Artist Relief Fund 9 March 2021 Note to Editors: Please find attached soundbites in English & Afrikaans from OfentseMokae, MPL.  eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0'])); The Democratic Alliance (DA) in the Northern Cape is reiterating our call on the MEC of Sport, Arts and Culture, Desiree Fienies, to ensure transparency and fairness in the rollout of the second phase of Covid-19 relief funding to artists and sportspeople. We welcome the announcement by the premier, Dr Zamani Saul, during his State of the Province Address last week, that R2. 1 million has been made available for the Artist Relief Fund. Many artists and sportspeople have been hard hit by the lockdown, unable to earn an income, with some relying solely on funding from the department. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));While the department finalises the payment of funding to the sport and arts sector, we appeal to this department not to allow the second phase to follow the same path as the first phase. Phase one was riddled with discrepancies, with many artists double dipping. The department must therefore ensure clarity of application criteria, as well as that all stipulated requirements are met. In the first phase, serious concerns were also raised regarding the manner in which funding was allocated. That process is currently being investigated by law enforcement agencies, the Hawks and Office of the Auditor General. The DA wants these investigations to be concluded as a matter of urgency and the reports tabled in the legislature. In the meantime, we also want the reassurance from the department that the call for applications will be done in a broad and open manner, so as to reach as many artists as possible. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));The DA has and will continue to monitor the rollout of Covid-19 relief to artists and sportspeople, and we will further make use of the upcoming departmental budget meeting, to scrutinise the process. The DA further encourages all artists and sportspeople to apply for assistance, to help them see them through these trying times.
