The Western Cape was the first province to begin vaccinations on 17 February. Since then, over 13 400 vaccinations have been administered in the province, and more than 73 000 healthcare workers have been vaccinated across the country. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_5',114,'0','0']));Minister of Health, Nomafrench Mbombo today attended the opening of the first private sector vaccination site at Gatesville Melomed. This will be a dedicated site for private healthcare workers in the metro receiving their vaccines. Tomorrow, the first vaccinations outside of the metro will also be administered, when rollout begins in George. Our three identified rural sites, Worcester, Paarl and George will receive a total of 2560 of the total 13 068 doses from this second tranche. Vaccines in this implementation study are being allocated in four separate tranches, spaced over eight weeks. In this tranche, the Western Cape is administering vaccines at seven sites, with seven more rural sites coming online in tranche three. The final tranche will be used to cover as many healthcare workers as possible who were not reached earlier and who wish to be vaccinated. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_1',115,'0','0']));In total, about 40% of the province's healthcare workers will be vaccinated as part of the Sisonke trial, which seeks to determine how the vaccine performs in real-life settings. Healthcare workers who are going to be vaccinated must remember to bring along the e-voucher for their vaccine which is sent via SMS, their ID, as well as proof of registration or a staff card proving that they are healthcare workers. These will be cross checked with the lists of names submitted by each healthcare facility to be vaccinated on the day. The Western Cape Government will not tolerate any vaccine fraud nor anyone attempting to pose as a healthcare worker in order to jump the vaccination queue, and investigations will occur. Vaccines will be rolled out to the general population in phases 2 and 3 of the vaccination programme, as approved vaccines become available. In phase 2, essential workers, those living in congregate settings and high-risk individuals including those aged over 60, and those with comorbidities aged 18 and over, will be eligible to be vaccinated. In phase 3, adults over the age of 18 will be eligible for vaccination. The Western Cape is continuing with its efforts to procure our own vaccine supply, as part of the four-prong strategy to manage Covid-19 which I detailed in my State of the Province Address last month. Procurement of this nature is a complex process which requires demand forecasting, analysis and regulatory approvals.  We are working hard on all these various aspects of procurement to source these life-saving vaccines for our residents.eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-banner-1','ezslot_0',116,'0','0'])); The vaccine is an important tool in helping to protect our highest risk groups such as healthcare workers, and our most vulnerable from becoming infected, becoming seriously ill, and dying. Until such time as we have reached widespread vaccination in the country, we must all continue to play our part to reduce the risk of becoming infected. With alert level 1 restrictions in place, we must all take responsibility to ensure that we protect ourselves and others. Mask wearing remains compulsory, and it is best to avoid large crowds, confined spaces and close contact. Wash your hands regularly and keep your distance from others to reduce the risk of infection.
