NWPL Speaker gives SCOPA a middle finger – again 4 March 2021 Note to Editors: Find attached soundbite in English by DA North West Chief Whip, Freddy Sonakile. The Standing Committee on Public Accounts (SCOPA) in the North West Provincial Legislature (NWPL), is seemingly third time unlucky after its third attempt to summon Speaker, SussanaDantjie and senior management of the Legislature, to appear before the Committee, has failed. Attempts by SCOPA to bring the Speaker to account dates back to 2019 and has been met with her blunt refusal to do so each time. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_4',113,'0','0']));In 2020, following the barrage of allegations of corruption and wrongdoing in the Legislature, which was followed by a protest action by employees who downed tools for a good 3 months, SCOPA again attempted to call the Speaker to account. This time round, the Speaker responded to SCOPA in writing, plainly stating that she will not appear and can only be summoned by the Standing Committee on Oversight of the Legislature. The Speaker’s refusal to appear, displays her ignorance of the mandate of SCOPA, which is to oversee the financial affairs of all state organs. She seemingly forgot that the Legislature is such an entity. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_6',114,'0','0']));The legal opinion sought by SCOPA confirmed that the Legislature must indeed appear and further cited that in the 4th and 5th Parliament, it appeared before Mr Chauke and Mahlakeng respectively, which were the Chairpersons at the time. Not even a legal opinion could move the Speaker to appear, eliciting the Committee to request the Legal Services for a plan of action on how to deal with the defiant Speaker. The DA is concerned about the precedent that is being created by this situation. It has always been our contention that the Speaker is a law unto herself and subsequently tabled a motion of no confidence against her. eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-4','ezslot_0',115,'0','0']));Her political power and protection from her party affiliates went to her head. This power trip is causing a confusion with the impartial governance role she is to play in the Legislature. The DA again requested that the Speaker and senior management be formally summoned, failure upon which SCOPA will lay criminal charges in line with Section 27 of the Powers, Privileges and Immunities of Parliament Act of 2004.
