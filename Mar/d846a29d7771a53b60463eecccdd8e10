DA seeks clarity on new regulations prohibiting food and drinks on planes 5 March 2021 The Democratic Alliance (DA) calls on the Minister of Transport, Fikile Mbalula, to provide the reasons behind the latest regulations that airlines are not allowed to serve food and drinks on board domestic flights. We are asking for a clear evidence-based reasons why this decision has been taken by government and whether the industry had been consulted and warned before these regulations were gazetted. The banning of food and drinks, except bottled water, has potentially adverse economic consequences on airlines as this is a loss of a revenue stream. In the government gazette published on 1 March, Minister Mbalula noted the newly amended directions, subdirection 6 (2) (o), which include:(a) An Operator conducting a domestic flight is not allowed to provide catering on-board the aircraft except bottled water;(b) A passenger on a domestic flight is not allowed to eat on board the aircraft. This in effect means passengers are not allowed to bring their own food or drink to consume and would not be able to buy said items additionally from the airline. Given the financial impact that these regulations can have on the industry, the DA would like the Minister to provide the rationale and reasons for this decision and whether the department and government has engaged with the airline industry before they came to this conclusion.
