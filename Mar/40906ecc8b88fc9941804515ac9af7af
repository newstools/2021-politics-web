EFF CALLS FOR THE IMMEDIATE REMOVAL OF INCOMPETENT AND RACIST NEWS ANCHOR STEPHEN GROOTES Tuesday, 09 March 2021 eval(ez_write_tag([[336,280],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0']));The EFF calls for the immediate removal of compromised, racist and incompetent NewzRoom Afrika anchor Stephen Grootes, for making a blatantly false and defamatory remark, whilst covering the common assault case involving the CIC Julius Malema and Commissar Dr Mbuyiseni Ndlozi. In a pathetic display of his bias and dislike of the EFF and it's leadership, the idiotic Grootes claimed that the Commander in Chief and Commissar Ndlozi were in court for killing police colonel Johannes Venter. It is the most idiotic and dangerous comment, idiotic firstly because the supposedly dead Johannes Venter has testified himself at court proceedings, and dangerous because it gives an impression to millions of viewers that the leadership of the EFF is on trial for murder. I accept no apology from a racist boy; he needs to be taught a lesson. They should be a consequence in every racist act. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));The talentless Stephen Grootes has shown on multiple occasions that his deep-seated and racist dislike of the EFF clouds his judgement, and has today gone as far as criminalising the President of the EFF without any logical cause. Grootes's distortion of a case in which the only dispute is around a racist police colonel unjustly denying the leadership of the EFF from burying their mother Mama Winnie Madikizela-Mandela is an outrageous step too far. We call on Newzroom Afrika to remove Grootes from air for his callous and foolish remarks and issue a public apology for the senseless and harmful comments made by someone in their employ. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_3',114,'0','0']));To continue to harbour a fool, who was overwhelmed by his own racism in their employ, will render Newzroom Afrika no different to the racist Enca, and we will have no choice but to treat them in the same manner. Earlier today, Stephen Grootes mistakenly referred to the current case involving EFF leader Julius Malema & Mbuyiseni Ndlozi as that of "killing‚Äù as opposed to assault. Stephen apologised immediately thereafter. We regret the error & extend our apology to Mr Malema & Mr Ndlozi. pic.twitter.com/j5xLRiUh1H Statement issued by EFF, 9 March 2021
