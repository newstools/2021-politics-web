IFP NEC calls on Zuma to appear before ZondoCommission 2 March 2021 The IFP National Executive Committee (NEC) notes with serious concern the statement released by former President Jacob Zuma's Foundation, accusing Deputy Chief Justice and Chairperson of the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture, Judge Raymond Zondo, of bending the laws to suit an agenda against the former President. The IFP NEC notes that the contempt of court and failure to appear before the commission by former President Zuma is unlawful - and intentional. We therefore reiterate our call on the former President to submit himself before the Commission to avoid the setting of a precedent that the former President - or any other citizen - is above the Rule of Law. We call on former President Zuma to lead by example and to submit his evidence before the Commission, as this very Commission of Inquiry was set up by him on instruction of the Public Protector, to address matters relating to State Capture. As a leader, former President Zuma's actions have the potential to be emulated. It would certainly not serve his legacy for actions that are inconsistent with our Constitution and democracy to be those he wants society to emulate. This is about the country and setting the record straight on State Capture and endemic corruption, which have weakened state institutions and have cost the country billions of Rands in losses.
