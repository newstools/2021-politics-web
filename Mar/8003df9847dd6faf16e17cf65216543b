SAHRC strongly condemns the recent attacks on Non-Nationals in the Durban CBD Monday, 08 March 2021 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_4',112,'0','0']));The South African Human Rights Commission (“the SAHRC”) is deeply concerned by the recent attacks on non-nationals, which commenced on Sunday 28 February 2021 at the Soldiers Way Market trading precinct / area in the Durban CBD that left several non-nationals including women injured and traumatised. It has also been alleged that members of the Umkhonto we Sizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMVA) attacked and assaulted non-nationals and petrol -bombed their shops / business in the Durban CBD on Monday 08 March 2021. The SAHRC condemns these on-going violent attacks and the looting and threats on businesses owned by non-nationals in the city. The SAHRC reminds all citizens, residents and other persons in the Republic that such acts are unlawful and unfairly discriminatory and that they are motivated by incorrect beliefs that others have no human rights based on their social origins. The Commission once again calls on all within South Africa to respect, protect and promote the rights of all within South Africa as the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, in particular, treat all within South Africa with equality and human dignity. The Commission remains concerned and extremely disturbed by these xenophobic acts which serve only to heighten and exacerbate the existing racial, social and ethnic tensions in the City which has the potential to trigger further xenophobic incidents and attacks on non-nationals in other parts of the province as well as nationally. The Commission’s KwaZulu - Natal Provincial Office is engaging with all relevant stakeholders in order to fully assess and investigate the matter. The KZN Provincial Office further continues to monitor the situation closely to ensure that the rights of all non-nationals are equally promoted and protected.
