MKMVA distances itself from the recent violence and looting by criminal elements exploiting concerns about illegal undocumented foreigners, and calls for criminal elements to be apprehended 11 March 2021 eval(ez_write_tag([[468,60],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_4',112,'0','0']));The Umkhonto we Sizwe Military Veterans Association (MKMVA) is deeply concerned about the violence and looting that took place over the past couple of days in Durban, and distance ourselves unequivocally from any such conduct. While MKMVA is on record as having expressed serious concerns about undocumented illegal foreigners, and specifically their illegal participation in the South African economy, we have throughout made it clear that we are fundamentally opposed to any violence, looting and unruly behavior in relation to any protest action in this regard. No member of MKMVA may ever make him/herself guilty of unruly, violent and illegal conduct. As law abiding South African citizens it is our duty to conduct all our activities within the parameters of the law. We have stated it in every media statement that we have issued in this regard. MKMVA can, and should, not be kept responsible for the behavior of criminal elements that have opportunistically latched onto, and exploit a volitile situation. eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_7',113,'0','0']));eval(ez_write_tag([[250,250],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_8',113,'0','1'])); .medrectangle-3-multi-113{border:none !important;display:block !important;float:none;line-height:0px;margin-bottom:10px !important;margin-left:0px !important;margin-right:0px !important;margin-top:10px !important;min-height:250px;min-width:250px;text-align:center !important;}MKMVA calls on all our members to distance themselves from any criminal activity, and to assist the law enforcement agencies to bring anyone involved in criminal activity to book. It is very unfortunate that the KZN Provincial Chairperson of MKMVA, comrade Themba Mavundla, has tried to cast aspersions on the President of MKMVA, comrade KebbyMaphatsoe, with regards to any unacceptable, violent and criminal activities that have taken place. The allegations that he made in this regard is totally devoid of any truth. As the MKMVA Provincial Chairperson in KwaZulu Natal it is his responsibility to deal with all matters in the province, and to maintain discipline and to ensure that no member of MKMVA is implicated in violent and illegal conduct.
