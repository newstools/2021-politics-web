SSA Judiciary probe at risk of undue influence 4 March 2021 The Democratic Alliance (DA) notes the announcement by the State Security Minister, Ayanda Dlodlo, that her Department will launch an investigation into allegations that the State Security Agency (SSA) allegedly bribed members of the Judiciary to sway judgments in favour of the politically connected. While we believe that an investigation into these serious allegations is necessary, we do not believe that the Department has the credibility to conduct an independent, fair and transparent probe.  How could she even consider allowing the SS Agency to investigate itself? The DA reiterates our call for President Cyril Ramaphosa to appoint a retired judge to investigate the nature of the allegations. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_3',113,'0','0']));The allegations that judges were bribed through an SSA slush fund are yet to be substantiated. However, the very nature of the allegations has had the effect of seriously eroding public confidence and trust in the Judiciary. Failure to deal with these allegations in a correct and independent manner could do even further damage. The DA is therefore against Minister Dlodo’s department being at the forefront of the investigation because of the possible undue influences from the SSA which could affect the outcome. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_5',114,'0','0']));A retired judge must be appointed by the President to scrutinise and test the validity of these claims Issued by Dianne Kohler Barnard,DA Shadow Minister of State Security, 4 March 2021
