Solidarity has the power to have Denel assets seized 4 March 2021 Solidarity today announced that it has obtained a warrant of execution to seize assets to the value of around R12,7 million from Denel. This comes after this state-owned enterprise failed to meet various contractual and statutory obligations towards its employees. “This is a huge victory for our members who had to endure a time of unprecedented uncertainty and tension. At least it gives our members a bit of a breather and they can sigh a sigh of relief in the knowledge that their overdue salaries would be partially covered in this way,” HelgardCronjé, deputy general secretary for the public sector at Solidarity said. Solidarity, however, points out that it only offers temporary relief to the employees at South Africa’s arms manufacturing giant and that the battle to turn Denel into a sustainable and viable business continues. “Employees have to bear the consequences of mismanagement at top management and board level far too often. With this we are also conveying a message that employees in the public sector are tired of constantly having to bear the brunt of corruption and ignorance at in their businesses,” Cronjé stated. “It is time for the state to realise that if it cannot make a positive contribution to these businesses then it must at least stop being such a major burden, prejudicing their proper running. We are delighted with the victory, but we have to keep fighting to ultimately turn Denel around and to create a work environment offering security and excellence to our members,” Cronjé concluded.
