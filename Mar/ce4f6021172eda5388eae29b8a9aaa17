Poor Gauteng learners did not receive dignity packs during the December holidays 8 March 2021 eval(ez_write_tag([[300,250],'politicsweb_co_za-box-3','ezslot_0',112,'0','0']));Many poor Gauteng learners across the entire province did not receive dignity packs from the Gauteng Department of Social Development (DSD) during the December holidays. This information was revealed by the Gauteng MEC for Education, Panyaza Lesufi in a written reply to the Democratic Alliance (DA) question tabled in the Gauteng Provincial Legislature. According to Lesufi, the Gauteng DSD is responsible for the distribution of the dignity packs in the province and had reported to the Gauteng Department of Education that no learner had received these packs during the holidays. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));Lesufi stated that his department provides a list of schools targeted for the academic year for both the dignity packs and feeding scheme to the Gauteng DSD. Failure by the DSD to distribute dignity packs during the December holidays is unacceptable as vulnerable and underprivileged female children still experienced menstruation and had nothing else to use. Furthermore, in the second quarter of the 2020/21 financial year, 179 606 Gauteng learners did not receive such dignity packs. In addition, the department also reprioritized R83 million from dignity packs to food parcels during its special adjustment budget for the 2020/21 financial year. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_4',114,'0','0']));This clearly indicates the lack of compassion by the department regarding the plight of poor learners in this province. The DA calls on the Gauteng MEC for Social Development, MorakaneMosupyoe to ensure that all our learners across Gauteng access dignity packs consistently without any interruptions, and that this service must be made a priority.
