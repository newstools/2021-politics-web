Freedom Under Law calls for suspension of Judge Hlophe following his dismissal of Bongani Bongo's corruption case 1 March 2021 Freedom Under Law is not concerned with the political consequences of Judge John Hlophe’s dismissal of the corruption case against former minister Bongani Bongo. Our concern is its implications for the administration of justice. This particular decision is clearly wrong and shows what harm just one dishonest judge can do. Since he tried to pervert the course of justice against Mr Zuma thirteen years ago, we have maintained that Judge Hlophe is unfit to be a judge. His contrived reasoning and perverse ruling last week demonstrate how dangerous it has been to allow him to remain on the Bench. An exemplary case of corruption has been frustrated, the  corrupt deed has gone unpunished and decent public servants have been defamed. We now publicly and urgently repeat our submission to the Judicial Service Commission that Judge Hlophe be suspended pending the conclusion of the proceedings for his removal from office. His conduct in the case against Mr Bongo constitutes yet another act of gross misconduct unfitting him for judicial office. Issued by Freedom Under Law, 1 March 2021
