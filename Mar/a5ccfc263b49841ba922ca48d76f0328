Learning, teaching disrupted by EFF at Pretoria North schools 8 March 2021 Note to Editors: Please find a list of our questions to the MEC for Education, Panyaza Lesufi here It is extremely concerning to note that the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) are once again disrupting learning and teaching at Pretoria North Schools, with a blatant disregard for the Constitution that protects a child’s right to basic education. The Danie Malan Primary School in Pretoria North has been shut down by the EFF, with chains and locks placed on the school gates. The Department of Education has advised parents to make alternative arrangements for their children. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-3','ezslot_1',113,'0','0']));Earlier in February learning and teaching was disrupted at the Gerrit Maritz High School, Akasia High School and Pretoria North High School. The EFF is demanding that learners who have not been placed at schools in the area, be allocated. While the DA understands the frustration of the delayed placing of learners, it is unacceptable that teaching and learning is disrupted. We are living in a ‘new normal’ due to the Covid-19 pandemic and every minute of teaching time is valuable and cannot be lost. eval(ez_write_tag([[580,400],'politicsweb_co_za-medrectangle-4','ezslot_4',114,'0','0']));I have already submitted written questions to the MEC for Education, Panyaza Lesufi about the current situation at the two schools that have been affected by protests to ascertain exactly how many learners remain unplaced, how many additional learners can be accommodated at the schools in the area, and if he has engaged with the parents on the matter. The DA has already called on the MEC to urgently place all learners who have not been allocated a school, to ensure that learning and teaching resumes for the academic year.
